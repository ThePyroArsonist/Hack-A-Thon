  <h1>American Sign Language Live Translator</h1>
  <p>This project is a demo of current technology that can be used to bridge the gap between those who 'speak' and do not 'speak' ASL. 
    This tech was developed through the use of Machine Learning technology developed by Google. If you cover the camera, this model 
    will classify the image as "nighttime," otherwise will classify anything else as "daytime." </p>
